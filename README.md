# Gene-NOP6
NOP6 is a gene that is code for a protein necessary for the ribosomal subunit of 40S to work, it can also recognize RNA due to it containing a RNA recognition motif (RRM). It is also hydrophilic, so it is essential for overcoming the stress of rehydration after dessication, though there is competing information on this topic. NOP6 could possibly be a fungi specific gene, as there have been no homologs found in higher eukaryotes.
