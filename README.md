# Gene-NOP6
NOP6 is a gene for a protein necessary for the ribosomal subunit of 40S to work, it can also recognize RNA due to it containing a RNA recognition motif (RRM). It is also hydrophilic, so it is essential for overcoming the stress of rehydration after dessication, though there is competing information on this topic. NOP6 could possibly be a fungi specific gene, as there have been no homologs found in higher eukaryotes. 
In a BLAST against the nr database the results were mostly the same strain of yeast.
In a BLAST against the pbd database there was only 1 result, which was the same yeast. 
In a BLAST against the refseq database the results were mostly different strains of yeast or fungi similar to yeast.
In a BLAST against the swissprot database the results were not very close to my gene, but most of them were related to RNA binding proteins, and dealing with (r)RNA.
